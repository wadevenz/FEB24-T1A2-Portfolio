## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to make a clean and functional website that maintained a visual appeal. Lets say "Friendly vibes with professional aesthetic". My goal was to make something of a platform to build upon as I gain more skills and grow into more complex programming languages e.g JS, then use to engage with the world of IT and web development. My hope is to prevent the 'TL;DR' or indiffernece of the user, but to have an engaging UX that people will be urged to look for more, hopefully. Simple but effective. 

## Functionality / Features

A large decision was to maintain most of the content on a single html page. This was to take advantage of the natural scroll process most mobile users are privy too. It also was an attempt to prevent disengagement from using multiple links for different sections of information. A navigation menu becomes visible for desktop users where scrolling may be less inherent. The fixed logo in top left corner also acts an anchor link to main section of home page, from both within main page and from external blog pages. Blog pages also navigate back to the "blog section" from the "Go back" link at the end of each blog. Blog pages on seperate .html files also play a role in fulfilling some assessment criteria... phewf!

Color palette was chosen for minamalistic elegance, basic dark/white combo for profesionalism, and an accent of chartreuse for colour that pops.

Content is kept brief to prevent laborious searching, with a "read more" accordion in longer content, used for mobile users.

Minor variation in typography in titles and content is meant to gain visual appeal with the hope for further engagement.

Responsive layouts utilise flexbox to change from rows and columns in differing viewports, columns predominant in mobile for smooth scroll. The Exp and Blog sections utilise this responsive change. All elements are also sized and postioned in mobile view first but adapt with aesthetic consideration to the larger viewport of desktop. The changing layout though is also aimed at breaking up visual patterns and maintain a positive UX.  

There is also some minor styling to blog section utilising the 'hover' pseudoclass to display color from grayscale. 

I also put a very simple color changing animation for a title announcing new projects, hopefully a distraction from the potential disappointing lack of current experience, but a small taste of whats to come.  


## Target Audience

My target audience is prospective employers looking to hire a junior developer — preferably here on the Gold Coast, up in Brisbane or a company who will allow me to work remotely. I know the industry is tough at the moment, and to get hired you need to stand out and make an impression. I designed my website to feel clean and seamless, but with touches of fun and colour to reflect my personality. I don't just want prospective employers to see what I can do (although that's important). I want them to get a sense of who I am — fun and easy to work with. The exact type of developer you'd want on your team.

I would also hope this site appeals to colleagues and developers in similar situations and provides an ability to network and collaborate.
