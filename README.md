## Purpose

The purpose of this project, was to make a clean and functional website that maintained a visual appeal. Friendly vibes with professional aethetic. 

## Functionality / Features

A large decision was to maintain most of the content on a single html. This was to take advantage of the natural scroll process most mobile users are privy too. It also was an attempt to prevent disengagement from using multiple links for different sections of information. A navigation menu becomes visible for desktop users where scrolling may be less inherent. The logo also acts an anchor link to main section of home page, from both within main page and from external blog pages. Blog pages also navigate back to the "blog section" from the "Go back" link at the end of each blog. 

Content is kept brief to prevent laborious searching, with an "read more" accordion used for mobile users.

The use of typography is meant to gain visual appeal with the hope for further engagement.

Responsive layouts using flexbox changing from rows and columns is also aimed at breaking up visual patterns and maintain a positive user experience.  

There is also some minor styling to blog section utilising the 'hover' pseudo class to display color from grayscale. 

## Target Audience

As would be expected, the target audience for this project would be prospective employers looking to hire junior web developers. The minamalist design is aimed to broaden target audience. I would also hope that this webpage could be used to network with colleagues and other professionals in the same or similar fields.
