                Away from the computer? I'm a proud girl dad, so you'll probaby find me at the local playground with a coffee, trying to adapt to the awkwardness of small talk with the other parents.

                   I started my professional career in healthcare, first working as a registered nurse before transitioning into paramedicine. Being a paramedic was a dream come true and I love my job.

                    But after almost seven years (and two kids) later, the shift work had started to take a toll. I was missing out on spending time with my kids, and maintaining a healthy routine was proving all but impossible. So, I needed to make a change.

                    My wife has worked in the software space for most of her career. She's closely with developers as a UX writer, and knows the industry inside-out. As crazy as the jump from paramedics to developer seemed, she convinced me that it would be a perfect fit for my skills and personality.

                   After studying to be a full stack developer with Coder Academy, I couldn't agree more. I get to flex my problem solving skills in a creative and technical environment. I'm challenged to craft elegant solutions to complex problems (although, thankfully no one's life is on the line â€” usually). And I get to be a part of a team, working together to do something cool. And that's pretty great.
